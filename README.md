# Demo Wiki
This wiki was created to explore how GitHub's Wiki's actually work!

## Creating Directories
Git was originally designed to track files and changes to them.<br>
Should an empty directory exist in any project, there would be no files within the directory to track.<br>
Thus empty directories don't quite make sense looking at it from the Git point of view.<br>
Hopefully this helps explain why it is not obvious how to create empty directories in GitHub! 

Since Git only tracks content, a common way for developers to push an (almost) empty directory to an initialized Git repository is to create an empty `.placeholder` file within that directory.

To create a new directory in a repository click create a new file.
Type your new directories name in the area followed by a "/" followed by a file named .placeholder

### Quote Text
To quote a line of text we start the line with a single ">" character.

### Highlight Code Snippets
To highlight a code snippet we wrap the word or snippet with the ` \` ` backtick character.<br>
` ` `<br>
`` ` ``<br>
<br>
<br>

### Highlight Code Blocks
To highlight a block of code we wrap the block with three ````` backtick characters.
