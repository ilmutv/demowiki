## Creating Directories
By default, Git is designed to track the content of only files.
  If a directory has no files in it, Git presumes there is nothing to be tracked.
This means that directories exist in Git only implicitly through their contents.

To create a new directory in a repository click â€œcreate a new file.
Type your new directories name in the area followed by a "/" followed by a file name.
