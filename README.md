## Creating Directories
By default, Git is designed to track the content of only files.<br>
If a directory has no files in it, Git presumes there is nothing to be tracked.<br>
This means that directories exist in Git only implicitly through their contents.

Since Git only tracks content, a common way for developers to push an (almost) empty directory to an initialized Git repository is to create an empty `.placeholder` file within that directory.

To create a new directory in a repository click â€œcreate a new file.
Type your new directories name in the area followed by a "/" followed by a file name.
